Today starts the journey into the world of web design, and the initial lessons have already imparted a wealth of valuable insights. 
Recognizing the significance of design is a foundational aspect of crafting effective and visually appealing websites.

At this stage, I've delved into the basics of the four main pillars of web design: color theory, typography, user interface design (UI),
 and user experience design (UX).

Color theory has become more comprehensible for me, thanks to resources like Adobe Color Wheel (https://color.adobe.com/ru/create/color-wheel), 
where I can create and experiment with color combinations.

Color Hunt (https://colorhunt.co/) has proven to be an invaluable tool for finding inspiration and ready-to-use color palettes, streamlining 
the process of selecting suitable colors for design.

Understanding the importance of fonts and their proper combinations now enables me to make more meaningful choices in typography for each 
project.

Grasping the principles of user interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) design opens up new horizons for me in creating more
 user-friendly and engaging web interfaces.

This learning phase has equipped me with valuable tools, and I eagerly anticipate continuing my exploration of web design to deepen my 
knowledge and apply it practically in future projects
